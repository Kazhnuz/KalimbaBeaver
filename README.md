# The KalimbaBeaver sound theme

![Kalimba](/banner.jpg)

The KalimbaBeaver sound theme is a proposal for new default system sounds for Ubuntu 18.04.
The intention was to create a cohesive set of sounds that will enhance the user experience without getting in the way. The KalimbaBeaver sounds are played on a kalimba to give the theme an african feeling. 
The kalimba is an African musical instrument consisting of a wooden board with attached staggered metal tines, played by holding the instrument in the hands and plucking the tines with the thumbs.

Enjoy!
